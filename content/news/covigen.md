## Mexican Consortium for Genomic Surveillance

The Mexican Consortium for Genomic Surveillance (CoViGen-Mex) is composed of various institutions. Its activities are carried out within the framework of the National Project for Research and Incidence in Virology of CONACyT, in coordination with the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) and in accordance with the guidelines for viral variant surveillance established by the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health. The incorporation of researchers into CoViGen-Mex is dynamic, and a group of molecular evolution specialists has recently joined, contributing to the analysis of data generated by the Consortium as well as by other institutions.
